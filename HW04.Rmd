# Question 3

```{r}
dat3 <- read.table("../HW04Data/prob3.dat", header = TRUE)
```

### Part A

__Check assumptions__

1) Is age correlated with days

```{r}
ggplot(dat3, aes(x = age, y = days))+
  geom_point()+
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Days appears to be correlated with age")

```

2) Is status not correlated with age

```{r}
ggplot(dat3, aes(as.factor(status), age))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

There does appear to be a bit of association between status as a factor and age, but for the purpose of this model we will assume that there is no correlation between status and age.

3) The beta null hypothesis

$$
\beta_{\text{below average}}=\beta_{\text{average}} = \beta_{\text{above average}} = \beta \text{ (common slope)}
$$

To check the homogeneity of the regression slopes

```{r}
dat3$status <- as.factor(dat3$status)
library(ggpubr)
ggscatter(
  dat3, x = "age", y = "days",
  color = "status", add = "reg.line", cor.method = "pearson"
)+
  stat_regline_equation(
    aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = "~~~~"), color = status)
  )+
  ggtitle("Linearity Assumptions of Recovery Days", subtitle = "Considering Patient Fitness Status & Age")+
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

This plot shows there is approximately equal slopes, which is good for our assumptions.

$$
H_o: \mu_{1} = \mu_{2} = \mu_{3}
$$

$$
H_a: \text{ Not all slopes are equal}
$$

OR

$$
H_o:\text{There is no relationship between exercise status and days to recovery, after adjustment for age}
$$

$$
H_a:\text{There is a relationship between exercise status and days to recovery, after adjustment for age}
$$

```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
fit = aov(lm(days ~ (as.factor(status) + age)^2, data = dat3))
summary(fit)
```

Because the interaction term is not significant, we will remove it from the model:

```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
fit1 = aov(lm(days ~ (as.factor(status) + age), data = dat3))
summary(fit1)

#Type III
library(car)
Anova(fit1, type = "III")
```

After adjustment for age, there is a statistically significant difference in days to recovery between fitness levels (status).

#### Test Statistic and p-value

$$
F(2,20) = 399.114;\space p < 0.0001
$$

```{r}
1-pf(399.114, 2,21)
```


### Part B

```{r}
coef(fit1)
```


$$
Y_{1j} = 3.908264 + 3.523424*\text{status 1} + 1.167286*\text{age}
$$

$$
Y_{2j} = 3.908264 + 1.676045*\text{status 2} + 1.167286*\text{age}
$$




### Part C

```{r}
summary(lm(days ~ age, data = dat3))
```

The estimate for the slope is smaller in the part c than in part b.

### Part D

```{r}
library(emmeans)
library(rstatix)

adj_means <- emmeans_test(data = dat3, formula = days ~ status, covariate = age)
get_emmeans(adj_means)
```

The group that appears to be driving the global signal from fitness level is status level 3, because the mean days for that group is much lower for that group.

### Part E

```{r}
summary(lm(days ~ as.factor(status) + age, data = dat3))
```

It again appears to be group 3 that is driving the global signal from fitness level, because status 1 is the baseline, and status 2 is an approximate 1.85 decrease in effect, and status 3 is a much larger 8.72 decrease.

### Part F

I do not believe that including patient age in this model was helpful, because we could see the effect of status on days without the adjustment for age.
